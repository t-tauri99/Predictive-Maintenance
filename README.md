##Predictive Maintenance for Truck Fleets
This repository includes two comprehensive Jupyter notebooks that apply machine learning techniques to predict maintenance needs and detect anomalies in truck fleet operations, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of maintenance processes.

###Overview
This repository contains two main projects:
1. Truck Maintenance Classification
2. Multivariate Time Series and Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance
Each notebook is structured to guide through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling phases, ultimately leading to practical insights that can help predict maintenance needs.

###Truck Maintenance
This project analyzes truck maintenance data to predict the need for future maintenance. It involves detailed exploratory analysis, preprocessing of data, feature engineering, and modeling using logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Key aspects include the prediction of maintenance needs based on historical data, focusing on various features such as mileage, vehicle age, and engine size.

###Multivariate Time Series and Anomaly Detection
This project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to handle multivariate time series data from truck sensors. It includes data cleaning, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting to predict potential breakdowns. Techniques like LSTM networks are employed to manage sequence prediction problems, providing insights into the operational patterns that precede maintenance events.
